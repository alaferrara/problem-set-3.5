    </br><p style="font-size: Medium;">Offense is the side in which the players have possession of the ball. It is their job to advance the ball towards the opponent's endzone to score points.
    </b>The eleven players on the offense are broken down into two groups: offensive lineman and skill players. The linemans' primary job is to block.
    </b></b style="font-size: 20px;">The skill players' primary job is to advance the ball either running with the ball or passing it.
    </br>The skill players consists of the following positions:
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Quarterback - a player positioned behind the center who directs a team's offensive play (throws the ball).</li>
        <li>Halfback - an offensive back usually positioned behind the quarterback and to the side of the fullback (carrying the ball on most rushing plays).</li>
        <li>Fullback - an offensive player in the backfield (blocks mostly).</li>
        <li>Wide Recievers - catches passes from the quarterback on passing plays.</li>
        <li>Tight-end - a hybrid position with the characteristics and roles of both an offensive lineman and a wide receiver.</li>
    </ul>
